The game world is presented in a 2D-side view to the player. The view will scroll horizontally to the right-hand side when the player character moves forward. The background shows distant canyons and clouds in the sky. The bottom of the level is filled with water and will instantly kill the player character if both get in touch with each other. The player character will move on and jump over to random rocks, sticking out of the water. The width and height will be different to make the game more challenging. The player is only in control of a jump button, which will keep the automatically forwardmoving player character from falling down into the deadly water.
